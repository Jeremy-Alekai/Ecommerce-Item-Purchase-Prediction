# Introduction

This project aims to predict online shoppers' purchase behavior using machine learning. The dataset used is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and contains various features such as the type of product, whether the user is a returning visitor, the time of day and week, the duration of the session, and various page views and interactions.

# Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project contains 12330 rows of data and several features including the type of product, whether the user is a returning visitor, the time of day and week, the duration of the session, and various page views and interactions. This is a classification problem, where the goal is to predict whether an online shopper is likely to make a purchase or not based on the given features.

Some challenges that could be encountered include missing values, inconsistent data formats, and outliers in the data. Additionally, the dataset contains a large number of categorical features, which may need to be appropriately encoded for modeling purposes.

# Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether an online shopper is likely to make a purchase or not based on the given features.

# Data Cleaning and Exploration

During the data cleaning process, missing values, inconsistent data formats, and outliers were addressed. Categorical features were appropriately encoded for modeling purposes.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to better understand the relationships between features and the target variable. This involved analyzing distributions of individual features, correlations between features, and how they relate to the target variable.

# Modeling

Various classification models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. The models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness of the results.

# Evaluation

The performance of the various models was evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best performing model was selected based on these metrics and further analyzed.

# Conclusion

The project was successful in developing a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether an online shopper is likely to make a purchase or not based on the given features. The selected model achieved high performance on the evaluation metrics, which suggests it can be used in real-world scenarios to make predictions.

Future work could involve further feature engineering and exploring different model architectures to improve performance even further.
